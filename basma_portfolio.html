    <h1> My Projects </h1>
  <h2>Dialysis patient’s helper Application </h2>
  <div id="paragraph1">
  <p><em><strong>Dialysis patient’s helper</strong></em> is an application that aims to help kidney failure patients.
     By providing them with the services they need to keep them healthy and happy.
     The application will allow patients to register and have a personal account.
     It will help patients to monitor their diet in a digital way rather than the usual manual way.
     And it will help them with their medication by allowing the doctor to access and write
     the patient prescription on the app
   Then the patients will get a notification whenever it’s time to take the medicine.
   Also, it will help the patient in communicating the doctor in the easiest way,
  so it will benefit both in saving their time.</p>
